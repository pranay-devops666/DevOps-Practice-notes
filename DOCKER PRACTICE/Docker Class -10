DOCKER COMPOSE PART-1
IN DOCKER WE HAVE 4 MAJOR PILLARS
1. DOCKER IMAGES
2. DOCKER CONTAINERS 
3. DOCKER VOLUMES
4. DOCKER NETWORKS
those all are we will use in real time scenarios
those 4 we will do integrate to DOCKER COMPOSE

DOCKER COMPOSE ---------> is used to create multiple services in a single host.

service means its a part of application
for example take an example of Paytm in it so many services are there like tickets booking, movie tickets booking binding all those applications we can say it as a application.
We are creating all services which are exist in an application at a time we are using DOCKER COMPOSE 
We are using DOCKER COMPOSE to create all services in the application at once.
like example frontend, backend and databse everything.

first launch one instance with t3.micro and keypair with 15gb ebs volume.
first download DOCKER

yum install docker -y && systemctl start docker

now install docker-compose



sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.29.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/docker-compose /usr/bin/docker-compose
sudo yum install -y python3-pip
sudo pip3 install docker-compose
docker-compose version


# Download the current stable release of Docker Compose
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.29.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose 
# Apply executable permissions
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
# Create a symbolic link
sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/docker-compose /usr/bin/docker-compose
# Install using pip (Python package manager)
sudo yum install -y python3-pip
sudo pip3 install docker-compose

#check version
docker-compose version


now write file for docker-compose

docker-compose file must be a specific name like compose.yml, compose.yaml, docker-compose.yml, docker-compose.yaml
these 4 formats will be spcific

vim docker-compose

yaml file starts with ---

---
version: "3"
